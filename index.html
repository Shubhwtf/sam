            <ol>
                <li>I’ve learned to be more patient and to let things develop naturally.</li>
                <li>You're not just anyone to me—you’re someone who matters deeply.</li>
                <li>I'm willing to wait and work on our connection, at your pace.</li>
                <li>Even though I messed up, I hope you see the potential we have together.</li>
                <li>We share something real, and I don’t want to lose that.</li>
